1.	While inside the syn folder, run the following command to add the Synopsys toolset to your PATH variable:
	
	source /ecelib/linware/synopsys15/env/dc.csh


2. 	Inside your synthesis script, the $design is assumed to point to your VHDL/Verilog/SVerilog design files, if this variable is already set in your environment, you don't need to run it.
	
	While outside the syn folder (where the design folder is located), run:
	
	setenv design `pwd`/design/

3. 	While inside the syn folder, the folllowing command will invoke the Synopsys Design Compiler (the synthesizer tool) and pass the synth.tcl script to run:
	
	dc_shell-t -f synth.tcl

4. 	If you want to work with Graphical User Interface (GUI), run the following command (instead of step 3):
	
	dc_shell-t -gui
	
	This requires you to copy and paste each step of the synth.tcl (without the comments), 
	and manually run each step in the "dc_shell>" command prompt.
	

5.	In order to exit the tool, type "quit".
